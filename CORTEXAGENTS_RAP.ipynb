   "source": "# Using Row Access Policies with Cortex Agents\nThis Notebook will help set up a Row Access Policy (RAP) on the underlying data that is accessed via the Cortex Agents API to illustrate how we can restrict a user or tenant's access to data in Snowflake in a way that allows us to use the SQL generated by Cortex Agent.\n\nThis Notebook uses the setup in the [Getting Started with Cortex Agents](https://quickstarts.snowflake.com/guide/getting_started_with_cortex_agents/index.html) Quickstart. We'll focus on protecting the `SALES_METRICS` table based on the `SALES_REP` column.\n\nThe primary challenge is that the SQL that is generated by Cortex Analyst (within the context of Cortex Agent) is returned as a string. We don't want to depend on the LLM adding the necessary predicates to restrict the user or tenant to just their data, so we either need to modify the SQL string or find another way. Modifying the SQL would require parsing the SQL and it can get complex. The option we consider is using Row Access Policies to impose that restriction to tenant data. \n\nFor this multi-user/multi-tenant scenario, we will use a session variable (we'll use `TENANT`) and use the value of that session variable in the Row Access Policy. We will protect all applicable tables with a Row Access Policy based on this sesison variable. The approach is that we will set the value of the `TENANT` session variable to be the user or tenant and then execute the generated SQL.\n\nThe application will connect to Snowflake using a service user (with a service role), issue Cortex Agents API calls, and when issuing SQL will first set the session variable and then submit the SQL. The example code for this applicaiton can be found [here](http://TODO-GET-ACTUAL-URL).\n\nA note about the Cortex Agent API. The legacy behavior of running the Cortex Agent API was that whenever SQL is needed to be run, Cortex Agent will return the results so far, ending with a `tool_use` message that includes SQL. The client needs to look at the response to see if SQL was returned, and if so it needs to run that SQL, note the Query ID of the SQL statement, and re-issue the Cortex Agent API call appending a new message that includes the Query ID of the SQL. At this point, Cortex Agent will continue its analysis and return the next response. In this legacy behavior, the client needs to supply the full agent YAML spec every time, and does not use named Agents."

Set up the Row Access Policy\nIn order to make the Row Access Policy performant, we will create a memoizable function that collects all `SALES_REP`s that a given `USERID` has access to. Then, we create a Row Access Policy that uses that function, passing in the value of the session variable (retrieved via the `GETVARIABLE()` function) as the argument.
